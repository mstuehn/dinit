== Version 0.7.0

This release adds a minor feature, and includes a re-work of some base functionality
(which should not affect most use cases).

 * dinitctl "restart" command added. Re-starts an already-running service without affecting
   activation or dependency links.
 * dinitctl "stop" command now requires a `--force` option if dependents of the specified
   service would also need to stop.
 * dinitctl "wake" command now reconnects dependency links from dependents of the specified
   service, and can only be used if at least one such dependent is started.

== Version 0.6.1:

This is a bug-fix release with several minor fixes:

 * Resource limits were not properly being set.
 * Prevent early termination when standard input is closed or set to a device which cannot
   be watched for input.
 * Control protocol fix, possibly not affecting any real usage.

== Version 0.6.0:

This release adds a number of minor features:

 * Better behaviour when boot fails. User can choose an action from reboot, resume boot process,
   start the "recovery" service, or power-off. 
 * New service settings for limiting resources at the process level: "rlimit-nofile",
   "rlimit-core", "rlimit-data", "rlimit-addrspace". Both hard and soft limits can be set.
   See dinit-service(5) for details.
 * New "env-file" setting allows per-setting environment to be specified via a file. The file
   is re-read each time the service process is started. 
 * Added a "--quiet" option to suppress console output from Dinit.
 * Dinit when run as a user daemon no longer logs via syslog. Logging to file can still be
   enabled via the "-l"/"--log-file" option.
 * Added a "--socket-path"/"-p" option to dinitctl, to specify the socket path for communication
   with the dinit daemon.
 
A number of minor bugfixes and other improvements are also implemented. An integration test
framework has been added with a small number of tests, to complement the existing unit tests.

== Version 0.5.2:

This is a bug-fix release for several minor issues which have been found in the preceding
release (0.5.1).

 * Fix logging failure after log buffer becomes full.
 * Fix readiness-fd notification not immediately updating service states.
 * Fix use of old settings in sample configuration for Linux.
 * Re-create control socket file node if it "disappears". Should solve issues if root filesystem
   is mounted read-write on boot.
 * Fix potential issue with service launch failure for services using a fixed notification fd. 

== Version 0.5.1:

This is a bug-fix release for several issues of varying severity which have been found in the
preceding release.

 * Improved logging behaviour when a service runs "on console" for a very short time.
 * Fix for crash due to SIGALRM on OpenBSD.
 * Fixes for compiling with Musl C library.
 * Fix dinitctl "enable" and "disable" commands when path to service directory is absolute.
 * "termsignal" setting renamed "term-signal" and now supports "KILL" signal. "termsignal"
   is still supported for compatibility with existing service descriptions.
 * Other minor fixes.

== Version 0.5.0:

This version adds S6-compatible readiness notification support, and adds support for updating
the "utmp" database when services start/stop (this functionality should be avoided if possible
since the "utmp" database is mostly an historical artifact, and system support is often prone
to issues which allow unprivileged users to prevent updates and deny or delay logins; however,
utilities such as "who" may depend on the database being updated appropriately). 

Other changes:
 * Add "-u" command line option to force running dinit as a user instance.
 * Add a "chain-to" service property to better support recovery services.
 * Add a "shares-console" service option to allow running services "on the console" without having
   them own it exclusively.
 * Add "inittab-id" and "inittab-line" service settings for utmp support.
 * Minor bugfixes.

== Version 0.4.0:

This version focuses on being more "distribution friendly". It adds mechanisms to add and remove
dependencies, either temporarily or persistently, between services without manual editing of
service description files.

Changes:
 * A new service description directive, "waits-for.d", allows specifying a directory for which the
   contents (filenames) are read as dependencies. This provides a convenient way to add and remove
   dependencies to service descriptions without editing the textual service description file. 
 * dinitctl has new commands, "add-dep" and "rm-dep", to add or remove a dependency between
   services. The dependency is not persisted and won't survive a restart. Check the man page for
   details.
 * dinitctl has new commands, "enable" and "disable". These permanently enable/disable
   a service for some target ("boot" by default) by creating/destroying a symbolic link
   in the waits-for.d directory specified in the service description (and create/remove
   waits-for dependency dynamically). Check the man page for details.
 * A code style guide has been added (in the "doc" directory).
 * More tests, minor bugfixes.
